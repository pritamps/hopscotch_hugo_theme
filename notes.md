# Notes

## Design Ideas

* [See mobile design for NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/opinion/government-shutdown-trump.html?): The app design is also very good. Mobile first!
* [Color palettes](https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/)

[Using flexbox and CSS to move the sidebar without media queries][flexbox-youtube-video]

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columsn: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(15rem, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 1rem;
}
```

## Tools I'm not yet using or learning

* [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/): Not interested yet because I'm not sure it's necessary for my website, and also because I want to minimize my use of JS
